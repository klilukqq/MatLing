He pushed the lift button for her. Of course, it was obvious, at this time of day, dressed for work, that she was about to go down.

Plus, she worked through her breaks, desperately trying to find extra time for all the work she had to do. One day, she get her dream job – just as soon as she knew what that was. 
Sometimes Victoria felt as if her sister had all the luck in the family. Not only did she run her own award-winning publishing company, she married an equally talented man, the gorgeous and funny Peter, whose only fault was not having a twin. Even the way they met sounded like the plot of a film. Charlotte had been having a run of bad luck, ending in a car accident that had threatened to leave her unable to walk. Peter, a new doctor at the hospital, had to perform several risky operations that they had thought wouldn work, but she was back on her feet within weeks. Even he joked that he had known he was such a good surgeon. He proposed two months later. Half a year after the accident, Charlotte had set up her company and now they lived in the most expensive part of London. Victoria tried not to be jealous of her sister for any of it – not the husband, not the successful business, not their beautiful house nor their children – but it was a level of happiness that she wished she could taste for herself.
